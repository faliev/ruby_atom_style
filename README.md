# ruby_atom_style
stylesheet for ruby for atom editor.

This is a repo for Atom Editor syntax style and theme to use with Ruby programming language. For now it's just an extended syntax file, but in the future might expand to full blown theme. This is Ruby centric for now as well.

Looks like this: <img width="1680" alt="Theme Screen Shot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288/166985550-eda7c8fb-74a0-4606-98d6-6f704002baa7.png">

This was accomplished by using UI theme "One Dark", syntax theme "Duotone Dark Amethyst", font: Dank Mono. 

To use: install and use both UI and syntax theme and then replace styles.less file with contents of file from this repo.
